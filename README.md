# MSBD 5008 Cascade Model Simulation

## Libraries Used

## Summary of Cascade Model Simulation Algorithm:
- All the Nodes in the network was set to 'B' before the Cascade simulation
- An inital set of Nodes will adopt 'A' before the Cascade simulation
- This algorithm will be using a basic Decision Based Diffusion Model to simulate the nodes making a decision based on its neighbouring nodes
- A node will switch from 'B' to 'A' if the payoff for adopting 'A' is higher

## Remarks
- A plot of the Graph Network before the Cascade and after the Cascade simulation will be generated for visual comparison
- At the end of the code, an interactive Graph Network will be generated using Plotly
- Further details of the analysis is found in the report
